Readme file for 3rd Year Graph Theory Project

This project involves writing a Python programme which takes in an expression.
It converts thies expressionto a postfix expression. 
It then turn this postfix compiles it and creates an NFA. 
It then takes a string or multiple strings and runs them through this NFA.
The strings are ether accepted or rejected, this is shown to user by returning either true or false.

When running this program the user will be shown a list of strings which are infix expression that they can use.
The user will be prompted to enter an infix expression.
They can choose from the ones above or pick one of their own.
The user will be printed the normal characters in the expression and the postfix expression.
The program will then print the inputted expression, the string thats being testing and whether it is reject or not.

Each part of this program will be explained in their own page in the "Wiki" part of this project"
